# Miner Merging System Analysis

## Current Issues

1. **Drag and Drop Logic Issues**
   - Miners don't properly merge when dropped on same-level miners
   - Old miners aren't properly removed after merging
   - Position tracking is inconsistent during merging

2. **State Management Problems**
   - Mining rates aren't properly updated after merging
   - Total power calculation is incorrect after merges
   - Balances aren't properly updated when miners are merged

3. **UI/UX Issues**
   - No visual feedback during merge attempts
   - No indication of possible merge targets
   - No animation for successful merges

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Improved Merge Logic**
   - Added proper validation for merge conditions
   - Implemented correct miner removal after merging
   - Fixed position tracking during merges

2. **Enhanced State Management**
   - Added proper mining rate recalculation
   - Fixed total power updates
   - Implemented proper balance updates

3. **Better User Feedback**
   - Added visual indicators for merge targets
   - Implemented merge animations
   - Added success/failure feedback

## Testing Results

✅ Miners now properly merge when dropped on compatible targets
✅ Old miners are correctly removed after successful merges
✅ Mining rates and power are accurately updated
✅ Visual feedback properly indicates merge possibilities
✅ Animations provide clear feedback for successful merges
